ssdp-client
=======
An asynchronous library for discovering, notifying and subscibing to devices and services on a network.

SSDP stands for Simple Service Discovery Protocol and it is a protocol that
distributes messages across a local network for devices and services to
discover each other. SSDP can most commonly be found in devices that implement
`UPnP` as it is used as the discovery mechanism for that standard.
